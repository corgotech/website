This is an open source project that we currently maintain that offers a way to send (or recieve) large messages through SQS in the Go programming language. AWS officially only supports Java and Python libraries, so there was a gap in a well-managed library for Go.

<br />

We also expanded upon base functionality offered by other libraries, offering a more friendly developer experience when using the client in a Lambda environment. CI/CD was put in place to ensure that the dependancies are always kept up to date and all changes are tested against actual deployed AWS resources to give confidence in making updates.
