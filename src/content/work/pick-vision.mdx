<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Description</h2>

We worked with the founder of Pick Vision to craft a user experience and product that brought their sports betting service to life.

<br />

Most of this project was focused on front-end experiences. We iterated on UI features and layouts to find a good balance in the functionality available to their customers. After aligning, we implemented the UI in Next.js, using SSR and React components to build out reusable, rich, and performant web experience. Heavy emphasis was made on making the mobile view of the web application very accessible.

<br />

In addition, we also provided support through suggested design for backend components. When connecting pieces of the UI to APIs provided by the founder, we were able to offer opportunities to optimize the data being sent and the compute resources being utilized to help reduce operating costs.
