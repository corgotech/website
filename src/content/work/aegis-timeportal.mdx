<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Description</h2>

We worked with Aegis to created a fully qualified timeportal system. It supports a wide array of
actions around managing, viewing, approving, and querying timesheets for their employees.

<br />

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Features</h2>
Implemented **role-based access control** with levels for Admin, Manager, Accountant,
and Employee. Managers were only able to view and approve any of their direct reports
time sheets. Accountants had full view access to the system, and had additional export
access to extract time information into Quickbooks. Employees were able to modify
their timesheet and submit it for approval.

<br />

Audit and compliance requirements were also considered. After timesheets were submitted by an
employee, they could not be altered (even by administrators). Only the employee is able to revise
their own timesheet. If there were disrepancies noticed by the manager who was approving the
timesheet, it would be rejected and the employee would correct and resubmit their time.

<br />

Managing different reporting schedules was also a feature we added to the website and backend. The
standard bi-weekly cadence was the default, but the administrators could change this cadence to be
any number of days that fit the billing requirements of the contract (e.g. every 10 days, every
month).
